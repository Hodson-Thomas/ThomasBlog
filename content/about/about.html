<h1>Who am I ?</h1>

<p>
    Hello everyone!
    I'm Thomas Hodson, a <span id="my-age"></span>-year-old French IT entrepreneur.
    I first started programming back in <date>2015</date> when I was in middle school. That makes me today a programmer
    with <date id="programmer-since"></date> years of experience.
</p>

<p>
    I'm passionate about discovering new domains and helping to innovate with my IT skills.
    I've decided to open this blog to share my passions and my knowledge about the IT world.
    Feel free to reach out to me
</p>

            During my computer science degree, I started working on professional IT projects. After a few months. I then
            decided to make it a "side-job". I opened a "micro-company" which is a simplified company for small business
            projects.

            MJCcraft is a Minecraft multi-player server.
            This project first started in 2019 with the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/keCo3xfH4V9Yd1sB9">MJC-CS
                (House of Youth and Culture - Social Centre) of Chenôve</a>. The purpose was to promote the creation of
            video club like ours to encourage players to socialise instead of isolating themselves.
            Our group recently split up (due to higher education studies), so me and another member of the group (<a
                href="https://github.com/aripot007">his github</a>), decided to continue this project during our free
            time. We programmed plugins for the game to extend it. I mainly work on the front-end of the website and on
            the in-game facilities for the updates (building structures, etc…). You can find a couple videos of this
            server in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNRND2F3U4rCCzSeHbCZLZBDjSUghvUUX">YouTube
                playlist</a>. Today the server is closed.

            This is a competition, for high school students, organised by ESA (European Space Agency). The purpose is to
            bring to life your own space agency by inventing and creating a satellite inside a soda can. This satellite
            must accomplish two missions:
        <ul>
            <li>The first one is imposed by the organisers.</li>
            <li>The teams choose their secondary mission.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I mainly worked as a software engineer. I was also the report writer of the team.

            After one year of work, we were titled as the French champions, and we had the honour to represent our
            country in the European phase of the competition.

            I've participated in the creation of an educational kit. It’s a laptops network on which we installed custom
            video games that we’ve programmed. These video games are developed as educative support for schools, middle
            schools, high schools and other types of studies. The purpose is to intervene at the request of teachers to
            complete their classes by creating a practical session for students. The intervention is mainly used for
            introduction or conclusion to a lesson.
